## Hi there 👋
  ### **_About Me_**
  👉 My name is Saad. I am from Karachi, Pakistan, a bachelor's student at Karachi University studying space sciences. ⭐When it comes to space and astronomy, most people think that is a very alien👽 thing to study or it is a very hard field of study🤷‍♂️. 💡In reality, space study develops curiosity and hungriness to find logical answers to things that seem difficult to understand.
